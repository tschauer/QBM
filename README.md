### Question 1

### What is the size distribution of the peaks?
(histogram)



### Question 2

### What is the chromosomal distribution of the peaks?
(barplot)


### Question 3

### What is the overlap between histone and factor peaks?
* subset of histone overlapping factor
* subset of factor overlapping histone
* intersect of histone and factor



### Question 4

### What is the average distance between peaks?
(average or histogram) <br>

* histone - factor
* factor - histone
* histone - genes
* factor - genes



### Question 5

### What is the distance of factor peaks to exons, promoters, 5´UTRs, 3´UTs?
Promoter: TSS +/- 250 bp <br>
Hint: ?promoters; ?threeUTRsByTranscript etc.



### Question 6

### What is the G,A,T,C frequency at the center of factor peaks?
center: 20 bp (hint: resize) <br>
get sequence from genome <br>

* letter frequency
* dinucleotide frequency 
* oligonucleotide frequency (4-mer)
